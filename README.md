An intelligent full-stack application that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to analyze financial transaction data and identify potential risks, duplicates, and suspicious patterns. This tool moves beyond traditional rule-based systems by using the contextual reasoning power of modern AI to provide nuanced, human-like analysis of financial data.

## üìñ Introduction

In the world of finance and operations, identifying anomalous transactions is a critical but often manual and time-consuming task. Traditional systems rely on rigid rules that can miss subtle, context-dependent risks.

This **AI Financial Anomaly Detection Agent** was built to solve this problem. It provides a user-friendly interface for uploading raw transaction data (CSV) and returns a sophisticated, AI-driven analysis in seconds. The backend uses a carefully engineered prompt to instruct **GPT-4o-mini** to act as a senior fraud analyst, allowing it to detect anomalies that are not just numerically out of place but also contextually suspicious.

This project showcases skills in full-stack development, applied AI, data analysis, and building practical FinTech solutions.

## ‚ú® Features

-   **üß† Intelligent Anomaly Detection:** Utilizes LLM reasoning to detect a wide range of anomalies, including:
    -   Duplicate transactions.
    -   Unusually high amounts for a given category.
    -   Transactions at odd hours (e.g., late at night).
    -   Suspicious vendor patterns.
-   **üìä Dynamic Results Dashboard:** Presents complex AI output in a clean, user-friendly interface with:
    -   **Summary Cards:** At-a-glance metrics for total anomalies, highest risk amount, and common issues.
    -   **Detailed Anomalies Table:** A sortable table listing each flagged transaction with its severity, confidence score, and a clear reason from the AI.
-   **‚¨ÜÔ∏è Simple CSV Upload:** Effortless file upload and parsing for any standard transaction CSV.
-   **üåó Dark/Light Theme:** A sleek, modern UI with a persistent dark/light mode toggle managed with Zustand.
